            <h2>What is Divorce?</h2>
            <p>Divorce is the legal process of officially ending a marriage, which terminates the legal responsibilities of the spouses 
                and allows them to remarry. This formal dissolution is granted 
                by a court or competent authority and addresses various aspects of the marital union, including property 
                division, child custody and support, and spousal support (alimony). The specific laws and grounds for 
                divorce vary by country, but in most places, it requires a legal proceeding to formally end the 
                marriage and return the spouses to a single status.</p>

                <h2>Current Laws in the PH</h2>
            <p>In the Philippines, there is no divorce, but marriages can be annulled under specific
                grounds listed in the Family Code, such as parental consent issues (age 18-21), 
                unsound mind, fraud, force, intimidation, undue influence, or physical incapacity to
                consummate the marriage, provided the issue existed at the time of the marriage. The
                most common and broad ground for annulment is psychological incapacity, which requires 
                proving a party's inability to fulfill marital obligations. An annulment case is a complex
                legal process that requires legal guidance and may involve expert witnesses like psychologists
                and character witnesses
            </p>

            <h2>Why Legalize Divorce?</h2>
            <p>Divorce should be legalized in the Philippines to protect individuals in abusive or irreparable
               marriages, offer a simpler and cheaper alternative to annulment, provide legal options for
               citizens regardless of their religious beliefs, and promote individual autonomy and a fresh
               start in life. While the Catholic Church opposes divorce, legalizing it would recognize the 
               reality of failed marriages and align with the Philippines' secular governance, allowing a more
               dignified and efficient resolution for unhappy couples.
            </p>

            <h2>International Comparison</h2>
            <p>Other predominantly Catholic countries such as Spain, Italy, and Portugal have divorce laws,
               providing that strong family values and divorce can coexist. These countries provide legal pathway
               to protect individals while valuing the sanctity of marriage. By studying international
               experience, the Philippines can learn how to craft a divorce law that respects both tradition and
               the realities of modern family life.
